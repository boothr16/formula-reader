# formula-reader
Program that parses chemical formulas by element

This chemical formula reader was developed for use by high school chemistry students. The program requires the files AtomCounter.cpp, Element.h, and Element.cpp to run. In order for the program to execute successfully, the student needs to type in a chemical formula that has correct "syntax." This reinforces good formula writing habits. This program will handle any chemical formula in which the subscripts do not exceed 10. The program also works on formulas containing parentheses!

Sometime in the near future, this program will also serve to balance chemical equations.

CHANGELOG
* Clean up this code by making it more modular.
